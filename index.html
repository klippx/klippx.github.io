						<div class="sectionContent">
							<p>
								Hello, my name is Mathias, and I specialize in building awesome web apps!
							</p>
							<p>
								I have an inquiring mind and an endless thirst for knowledge. I want to learn about everything I encounter, and I want to master everything I learn.
							</p>
							<p>
								For a few years I have been working in a number of different production web applications. During this time I have been intensely exposed to the full stack. I have thrived, and achieved an excellent level of mastery in everything between back-end to front-end. And most importantly, I have found my passion in life: Web development.
							</p>
							<p>
								My preferred tools are Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Angular.js

							<h2>Senior Developer at Apoex</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">November 2012 - Present</p>
							<p>
								After many years in the telecom industry I needed a change. I fell in love with Ruby on Rails, and got into web development at Apoex.
							</p>
							<p>
								For about 2.5 years I worked on a web based journaling system for veterinarians which was delivered to Distriksveterin√§rerna as their custom built next generation system.
							</p>
							<p>
							This system was after delivery adapted to the private market and marketed as a cloud service. This included among other things making the application multi-tenanted. Please visit <a href="http://linkjournal.se">linkjournal.se</a> for more information about the product.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently I am working on a Dosage system which manages the production, packaging and delivery of medicinal dosage to people under inpatient care.

							<h2>System designer at Tele2</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">June 2006 - October 2012</p>
							<p>
								I felt passionate about telecom and billing, so I decided to continue working for Tele2.
							</p>
							<p>
								We rolled out to several countries with fixed line, adsl, voip. The product was very complex: We integrated with several different banks in different countries, we provided a platform which supported differences in rules for (among many other things) accounting, charging, campaigns, packaging and pricing, and even products.

							<h2>Developer at Accenture</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">November 2004 - May 2006</p>
							<p>
								I started my career as a developer for Accenture, at the Tele2 project. The ambition was to replace their billing system with a custom one built in <a href="http://www.csgi.com/solutions/revenue-management/convergent-rating-and-billing">Singl.eView</a>, and roll it out to 24 european countries.
